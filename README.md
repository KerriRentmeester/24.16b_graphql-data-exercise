# **Project Name**:

24.16b GraphQL Restaurant data exercise

# **Description**:

This project's purpose is to add, edit, delete, and display data in the GraphQL interface in order to familiarize myself with working with data via the GraphQL interface. Because of this purpose, this is more of an exercise than a project. 

This exercise highlights my capabilities in Javascript, React, Node.js, npm, Express, and GraphQL. This exercise demonstrates my beginning skills in employing Docker and MongoDB, and demonstrates my initial steps into full stack development. I worked on this particular exercise in October of 2023, during module 23 (after 23.6) from the MIT xPro via Emeritus bootcamp I was enrolled in called "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN."

# **Dependencies**: 
The exercise relies on the following dependencies: Express, GraphQL, and Express-GraphQL.

# **Usage**:
To run my project on your machine, download the files onto your machine or clone the repo. 
* Type terminal command: node index.js
* In a browser, navigate to http://localhost:5500/graphql.
* The exercise is to practice writing queries and mutations. Try writing one for each: 
** restaurant: This gets a single restaurant based on a provided ID. 
** restaurants: This gets a list of all restaurants. 
** setrestaurant: This creates a new restaurant. 
** deleterestaurant: This deletes a restaurant based on the provided id.
** editrestaurant: This updates a restaurant based on the provided id.

# **Support**: 
Please contact me via email at krentmeester@uwalumni.com.

# **Roadmap**: 
I don't really see a likely future improvement to this as a "project" because it is more of an exercise. One could further challenge themselves by adding to the index.js file to add more query/mutation opportunities. Another idea would be to add complexity to the "types".
